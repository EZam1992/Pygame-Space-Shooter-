# üöÄ Space Shooter

A 2D top-down arcade-style space shooter game built with **Pygame**. Control a spaceship, dodge falling meteors, and destroy them with your laser cannon to survive as long as possible. The game features smooth controls, sound effects, animated explosions, and a retro-themed starfield background.

## üéÆ Gameplay Overview

You control a spaceship that can move freely across the screen using the arrow keys. Meteors fall from the top of the screen, and you must avoid them or shoot them down. Lasers are fired with the spacebar and have a cooldown to prevent spamming. Each destroyed meteor triggers an explosion animation. Your score is based on how long you survive.
